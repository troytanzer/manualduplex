Quick program to allow single sided document feeder to scan two sided papers

Cleaning up old paperwork, I needed to scan old bills and the like that are printed on two sides.  I didn't like having to
rearrange the pages between the front and back side scans so I wrote a quick python program to do it.  But, I couldn't find
documentation on the python-sane package as to how to use the multi_scan option, when to open/snap/close/etc, so I experimented
a bit and got something that works.  

Very little error handling, but so far things *just work*.
